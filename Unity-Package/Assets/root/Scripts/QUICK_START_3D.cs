Solution to Gimbal Lock Issue

PROBLEM SOLVED:
The original 2D components suffered from "Gimbal Lock" causing:
- Incorrect starting positions when holding phone vertically vs horizontally  
- Jerky rotation at certain angles
- Loss of one degree of freedom during rotation

SOLUTION:
New 3D components use Quaternion arithmetic throughout to avoid Gimbal Lock

QUICK START GUIDE:
1. Replace your existing 2D components:
   - GyroRotator2DAttitude â†’ GyroRotator3DAttitude
   - GyroRotator2DGravity  â†’ GyroRotator3DGravity
   - GyroMover2DAttitude   â†’ GyroMover3DAttitude
   - GyroMover2DGravity    â†’ GyroMover3DGravity

2. Update your maxOffset settings:
   - Old: Vector2(x, y) 
   - New: Vector3(x, y, z) - now supports Z-axis!

3. Configure the new inverseZ property if needed

4. Enjoy smooth, consistent gyroscope behavior!

AVAILABLE COMPONENTS:
â–¶ GyroRotator3DAttitude  - Smooth attitude-based rotation using Quaternions
â–¶ GyroRotator3DGravity   - Gravity-based rotation with 3D support
â–¶ GyroMover3DAttitude    - Position movement based on device attitude
â–¶ GyroMover3DGravity     - Position movement based on gravity vector

TECHNICAL BENEFITS:
âœ… No more Gimbal Lock issues
âœ… Smooth rotation at all angles  
âœ… Consistent behavior regardless of phone orientation
âœ… Full 3D support including Z-axis
âœ… Better interpolation using Quaternion.Slerp
âœ… Same familiar API as 2D components
